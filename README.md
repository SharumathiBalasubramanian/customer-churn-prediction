Telecom Customer Churn Prediction – XGBoost + SHAP Explainability  
A complete end-to-end machine learning project for predicting customer churn using telecom call usage data.  
This project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, XGBoost model training, SHAP-based model explainability, and business insights for reducing churn.

---

Project Overview:  
Telecom companies face high costs associated with customer churn. This project uses real call usage attributes to build a predictive model that identifies customers at high risk of leaving.

The solution is built using:
- **Python**
- **XGBoost**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **SHAP explainability**
- **Google Colab notebook**

The model provides:
- High-performance churn prediction
- Global feature importance (SHAP summary + beeswarm)
- Local explanations for individual customers
- Practical business insights for reducing churn
